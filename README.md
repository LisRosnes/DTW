# DTW
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a technique used to measure the similarity between
two time series, even if they vary in time or speed. Unlike traditional distance metrics
like Euclidean distance, which requires the time points to be aligned, DTW can handle
cases where one time series is stretched or compressed relative to another. Write a Python
code to calculate the Euclidean distance and DTW for the the following time series:

This python code calculates the Euclidean distance and DTW for a time series. A sample input is given of a small subset
